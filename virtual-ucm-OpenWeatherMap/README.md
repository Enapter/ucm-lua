## First Start

This example Blueprint takes the temperature and humidity from [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/current) and shows on the Dashboard of Enapter Cloud.

For the start you need to:

1. Define your city id in the **cityid** variable. List of ID's is available at [OpenWeatherMap site](http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/)
2. Define your OpenWeatherMap API Key in the **appid** variable. You can get it on your [account page](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)
